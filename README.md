##CDP Support Agent Chatbot

Features
1. Answer "How-to" Questions
The chatbot will understand and respond to "how-to" questions about each CDP. It should be capable of:
Answering questions about how to perform specific tasks within each platform.
Example questions include:
"How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
"How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
"How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
"How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"
2. Extract Information from Documentation
The chatbot will be able to retrieve information from the official documentation of each CDP:
Segment Documentation: Segment Docs
mParticle Documentation: mParticle Docs
Lytics Documentation: Lytics Docs
Zeotap Documentation: Zeotap Docs
The bot will be able to navigate through the documentation to locate relevant sections and extract the required steps or instructions.
3. Handle Variations in Questions
The chatbot will be designed to handle variations in how questions are asked:
Size Variations: Even extremely long questions should be handled without breaking the system.
Irrelevant Questions: The chatbot should identify and gracefully handle questions not related to CDP platforms (e.g., movie releases, general tech questions).
Synonyms and Rephrasing: It should be able to handle different ways of asking the same question (e.g., "How to integrate my data with Segment?" vs "What is the process for connecting data to Segment?").
4. Cross-CDP Comparisons (Bonus Feature)
The chatbot will be able to answer comparison questions between the four CDPs. Example questions include:
"How does Segment's audience creation process compare to Lytics'?"
"What are the differences in how mParticle and Zeotap handle data integration?"
5. Advanced "How-to" Questions (Bonus Feature)
The chatbot can handle more complex, advanced questions about each CDP, including:
Detailed guidance on advanced configurations or integrations.
Use cases and custom workflows that go beyond basic functionality.
